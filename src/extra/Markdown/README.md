# Markdown

A simple component for rendering [GitHub flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). This component
sanitizes input.
This component is not loaded by default as it relies on a markdown parsing package
that you may not want to include in your application.
You can load this component using:

```
import { Markdown } from 'rendition/dist/extra/Markdown';
```

If you need to customize the conversion of markdown to HTML you can supply the `sanitizerOptions` prop. In this case, use the defaults as a starting point for your options:

```
import { Markdown, defaultSanitizerOptions } from 'rendition/dist/extra/Markdown';
```

Generated html inherits styles from rendition components. i.e an anchor will be
rendered as a `Link` component.

Html inside the markdown is sanitized and stripped of any inline js and css. so
they will always be rendered.

Components can be overridden by using `componentOverrides` prop.
